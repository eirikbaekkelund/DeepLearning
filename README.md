# DeepLearning
personal files for COMP0197 at UCL

This is my personal implementations of the following tasks:

## Task 1
* Implement a least squares approximation of high degree polynomial weights of 1 degree higher than ground truth function 

* Implement a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for finding optimal weights of the same as above in PyTorch 
#### Task 1a
* Implement an SGD for finding optimal degree of fitted polynomial

## Task 2
* Implement the mixup algorithm on the CIFAR-10 Dataset to train on a ResNet50 model.

## Task 3
* Ablation Study to impact modifications of the network using separate optimizers from Task 2.
